# MXET-300-502-Final-Project
# Repository of files used for the final project: Color Tracking Unit (ColTUn)
# By: Michael Townsend, Kevin Leonard, Kenny Nyugen, and Jordan Rhodes.

# You will need a fully assembled SCUTTLE robot for this project.
# Start by powering the BeagleBone Blue and connecting it to your computer as a second wifi.
# Then open cloud9 at http://192.168.8.1:3000/  and NodeRed at http://192.168.8.1:1880/
# You will need to have all of the files in the repository downloaded in a folder on Cloud9.
# And run the NodeRed script to use the correct GUI dashboard.
# To run the program, use Linux command line in Cloud9 and enter "bash start_mjpg_streamer.sh coltun.py".
# You will need to select a color for the robot to track when the program starts by using the slider in NodeRed.
